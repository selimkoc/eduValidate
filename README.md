Domain extension limitation for new users for EDD (Easy Digital Downloads) plugin for Wordpress

This code is created for limitation of .edu, .ac, and .sch.co.uk domain extensions. You can modify it for other domains.

It loads CSS to head of html page,if you prefer to add css separately, you can cut the style part from js files and add it to your CSS file or a separate CSS file.

The notification message is on top of the file, you can edit the text as you wish.

It both restricts new user register form & chechout page form.

It would not collapse with other tooltip plugins. The project I wrote this code was blocking .tooltip() functions somehow, so I wrote simple standalone tooltip to it.

The code is depends on Jquery.
